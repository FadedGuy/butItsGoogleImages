# but Its Google Images
The idea for this project is that I was watching youtube at 3AM like some of us do and stumbled upon a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJvK3WVyIfw&t=263s) that caught my attention called "Rap God but every word is a Google Image", and so I said to myself, I could automate that, and thus here we are.
I would say code is mostly completed since it does a pretty good job without employing AI for the speech recognition for an ever more accurate experience, but it's quite good either way. 


## Requiered libraries
The requiered libraries that most likely you would need to download are:
* pip install request_html
* pip install opencv-python
* pip install youtuve_dl
* pip install pydub
* ffmpeg


Feel free to give any feedback and/or issues.
Note : It works better with songs that don't have a lot of instruments going on the background.

```python
